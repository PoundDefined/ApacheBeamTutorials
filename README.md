Expected output will be in package root dir in `ApacheBeamTutorials/out`

There will be 2 files emitted, but one will be empty, this is probably due to: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72126198/how-can-we-prevent-empty-file-write-in-dataflow-pipeline-when-collection-size-is

Expected output in file: 

```
REQUEST val
RESPONSE val2
```
